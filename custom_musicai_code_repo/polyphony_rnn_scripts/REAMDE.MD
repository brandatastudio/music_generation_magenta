#Here we implement the basic algorithm, polyphony rnn, of course before launching the scripts in this folder we need to have organized the dataset , inside training data folder, and have launched sequencefile.sh 


remember that right now we need to modify the folders locations in the scripts, to make sure they point to a folder above


Also https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta/tree/master/magenta/models/polyphony_rnn here is all the docs you need
